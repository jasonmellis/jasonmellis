<h2>About</h2>

<p>Jason here. I love people, sailing, cycling, hiking and technology. Through sailing, I&#39;ve learnt how to be resourceful, patient, careful and have at times had to struggle upwind through the challenges of life. I lost my Mom suddenly three days after my 23rd birthday which was the most difficult period of my life to date. I think the shock helped layer me in resiliency. I cycled from Quebec City to Toronto in 2015 and then from <a href="https://www.guelphtoday.com/local-news/cycling-to-fight-breast-cancer-330278">Toronto to Quebec City in 2016</a> with my partner for the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation and it was that event that helped make cycling a big part of my life. In the summer of 2020, my partner and I cycled 1940 km for the <a href="https://canadianwomen.org/blog/what-defined-my-grandmother-was-being-a-powerful-woman-who-was-an-inspiration/">Canadian Women&#39;s Foundation</a> through our project, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wheelsofstrength1940">Wheels of Strength 1940</a>.</p>

<p>I support people to get results beyond what they imagined @ <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>. We are also hiring! I rescue dogs, drink too much coffee and love supporting local businesses and indie developers. Previously I was helping students navigate the challenging application process to get into Ontario universities @ <a href="https://www.ouac.on.ca/">OUAC</a> in Guelph.</p>

	<li>This was my first experience creating a new project from scratch and while it didn&#39;t quite work out the way I wanted it to, having been taught lessons on sponsorship, partnerships, relationships and creating something from the ground up gave me a never give-up resolve. It also taught me that I needed to finish high school.<br/></li>
</ul>

<h1>Languages.</h1>

<p>Languages have been a huge part of my life growing up. When I was a teen, I would spend time when I was supposed to be doing homework browsing language websites online, such as Omniglot and practicing foreign alphabets.</p>

<p>I learnt how to read and write in Greek and found it absolutely magic that I could read the language but not fluently speak it! </p>

<p>My love for language ultimately brought me to Quebec City in 2008, where when I arrived, I spoke no French but over the course of 8 years, became completely bilingual.</p>
