# Projects.
## Co-Founder @ Wheels of Strength 1940
- My partner and I started this to honour my grandmother *Oma* and work with the Canadian Women’s Foundation. 
- We cycled 1940 km before September 13 when my grandmother would’ve turned 80. She died of Alzheimer’s but being a powerful woman who carved her own path at a time it wasn’t common was what defined her so that’s why we chose to partner with the Canadian Women’s Foundation to raise awareness of gender equality.

It also taught me that I needed to finish high school. 
# Languages.
Languages have been a huge part of my life growing up. When I was a teen, I would spend time when I was supposed to be doing homework browsing language websites online, such as Omniglot and practicing foreign alphabets.

I learnt how to read and write in Greek and found it absolutely magic that I could read the language but not fluently speak it! 
My love for language ultimately brought me to Quebec City in 2008, where when I arrived, I spoke no French but over the course of 8 years, became completely bilingual.
