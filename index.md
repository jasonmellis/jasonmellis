> Sailing is a technological response to wind and waves that requires both ingenuity and courage. For those that are captivated by it, the challenge is the very reward. I’ve been captivated by sailing since I was 4 years old and sailing has driven how I make decisions not just on the water, but in life.

### Hey there, thanks for visiting!

Jason here. I love people, sailing, cycling, hiking and technology. Through sailing, I've learnt how to be resourceful, patient, careful and have at times had to struggle upwind through the challenges of life. I lost my Mom suddenly three days after my 23rd birthday which was the most difficult period of my life to date. I think the shock helped layer me in resiliency. I cycled from Quebec City to Toronto in 2015 and then from [Toronto to Quebec City in 2016] with my partner for the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation and it was that event that helped make cycling a big part of my life. In the summer of 2020, my partner and I cycled 1940 km for the [Canadian Women's Foundation] through our project, [Wheels of Strength 1940].

I support people to get results beyond what they imagined @ [Shopify]. We are also hiring! I rescue dogs, drink too much coffee and love supporting local businesses and indie developers. Previously I was helping students navigate the challenging application process to get into Ontario universities @ [OUAC] in Guelph.

I approach everything I do with love, care, a smart attention to detail and unsettled enthusiasm. Also with dogs, coffee and plant-based food.
